                The director of Sage One West Africa, Nikki Summers, said statistics
                shows that 70 - 80 percent of businesses fail in the second year basically
                due to lack of insight in their business. <br>
                They try to run it on excel and that generally does not work. Because
                of that lack of insight in their second year, they start running into 
                operational troubles due to cash flow.

                The second problem with the cash fund issues is that they need funding 
                to start growing their business but banks are not willing to give them
                loans because they cannot provide proper financials as proof that they 
                are capabale of paying off their debts.

                Statistics released by the Sage One company indicates that SMEs owners
                spend 52 hours a week on administrative tasks, which is over two days of 
                distracton rather than focusing on the core business, as a result of running
                data and bookkeeping manually.
